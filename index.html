		## Real Estate Securities <span class="subtitle"><br>It is a huge topic area, vast literature: read, read, read.</span>

		* Understanding REIT and property company history is essential
			- Standard textbooks for basics, e.g. Brueggeman & Fisher or Geltner, Miller et al.
			- Market data and background material from industry associations, e.g. NAREIT and EPRA plus news feeds on SNL
		* REITs are a global vehicle now, not just a US story
			- However, US REITs represent more than 50% of global listed real estate and dominate global indices (and research)
			- REIT rules and REIT investment characteristics differ by market structure and legislation
		* REITs form a dynamic area of research, journal articles are essential to developing an understanding of this asset class.

		* Basic Premise
			- Listed on stock exchange (sometime more than one)
			- Stock readily traded & price quoted instantaneously
			- Sell equity & debt to multiple investors
			- Governed by boards of directors owned by shareholders
		* Business Model
			- Buy or develop real estate either to hold or trade
			- Most raise debt financing alongside equity
			- Limited governance/control for the “owner”
		* Nuances
			- May be able to opt for tax neutral status with constraints
			- Generally internal management (but not necessary)

		## REOC vs. REIT <span class="subtitle"><br>Property Companies and Tax: This is why REITs are attractive</span>

		* Own shares in Real Estate Operating Company (REOC) or own real estate?

		* Tax position: Own the real estate
			- Receive rental income, deduct costs: determines tax liability
			- Trade property at profit, pay capital gains tax

		* Tax position: Shares in property company
			- Company rental income, less costs gives tax liability
			- Pays tax, distributes dividend to shareholder
			- Dividend taxable for shareholder
			- Company sells property, makes capital gain, pays tax
			- Investor sells shares, makes capital gain, pays tax

		* This tax leakage leads to demand for REITs

		* Tax neutral, provided REIT meets qualification rules

			- Limited insider dominance: largest five shareholders may not hold more than 50%
			- Assets: at least 75% of total assets in real estate assets, cash or government securities
			- No more than 25% of assets may be represented by securities other than government securities
			- Max 20% of assets within taxable REIT subsidiaries
			- Income tests: 95% of income from dividends, interest, and property income AND >= 75% of gross income from rents of real property, interest on mortgages, gains on sales and dividends from REITs
			- Distribution: 90% of taxable income must go to shareholders
		* They can develop—as long as they adhere to above rules

		* From 1960s to mid-1990s small, uninteresting Sector
			- Significant role of mortgage REITs
			- Too small to feature in index-tracking portfolios, few analysts
			- Constraints on holdings from limits on investor control
			- High share of retail investors: noise trading and volatility?

		* 1990s Changes
			- Creation of Umbrella–Partnership REITs (UPREITs)
			- Look through procedures allow larger institutional holdings
			- Growth in capitalization – more analysts and research
			- Growth in capitalization – included in major indices, ETFs, MFs.
			- Capozza calls this “the new REIT era”
			- Do the changes make REITs more like equity investments?

		* Institutional capital hunting for yields?
		* International capital hunting for yields?
		* Creation of separate GICS classification for real estate? Forces index trackers to adjust holdings of real estate?

			- Accounting IFRS versus US GAAP on fair value
			- Leverage rules differ
			- Rules on allowable holdings differ
			- Rules on allowable development differ
			- Tax rules differ – in particular regarding depreciation
			- rules on distribution (and how it is treated) differ

		* Must make assumptions about taxes and beta of debt
			- results fairly robust to modifications
			- Use spliced BOE data for int rates
		* Assume average 40% D/V, 0.667 D/E ratio
			- Obviously, gearing was not constant from 2000…
		* M & M:
			- `$ r_e = r_a \frac{D}{E} (r_a - r_d) $` and `$r_a = \frac{r_e + r_d \frac{D}{E}}{1+\frac{D}{E}}$`
			- Adjust equity market returns `$r_e$` to estimate underlying asset returns `$r_a$`

		* Do listed real estate returns reflect direct real estate or general stock market?
			- Use international sector-level data for US, UK and Australia
		* Study covers the short- and long-term dynamics of the assets, correcting for leverage in the direct real estate indices
		* Results suggest that long-run REIT market performance is more closely related to the direct real estate market than to general stocks, similar response to shocks in fundamentals
		* Consequently, REITs and direct real estate should be relatively good substitutes in a long-horizon investment portfolio

		## Triumph of REITs? <span class="subtitle"><br>Transparency, liquidity, ease of entry and exit.  Why isn't all RE owned by REITs?</span>

		* Additional organizational layer
			- Direct costs: substantial reporting/listing costs
			- Indirect costs: conflict of interest between owners and management possible
		* Corporate control for REITs
			- REITs leave little free cash flow for management - does this reduce agency problems? But no large blockholders allowed...
			- Agency problems mitigated by corporate control in regular corporations
		* REIT management has (some) discretion: accounting, payout ratios
			- Corporate controls matter for REITs with low payout ratios

		## No control <span class="subtitle"><br>Church of England lost 40 million—and reputation—in property deal</span>

		* Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town are were sold to consortium led by Tishman Speyer / Blackrock for $5.4bn in 2006 (just before the GFC).
			-	Controlling partners had little equity in deal, aggressive gearing + institutional money (CalPERS, Church of England, ...)
			- Debt burden too high, aggressive attempt to raise rents did not succeed, foreclosure. Investors lost invested funds—and potentially more.
		* CalPERS, America’s largest pension fund, terminated BlackRock after disaster

		Notes:


    * If the asset had been owned directly and entirely by the Church Commissioners, they’d have not geared up as aggressively, and they might have been able to weather the GFC (bear in mind when the consortium acquired the asset). Whether this is down to their partner / consortium selection (i.e. poor cultural alignment) or specifically a lack of (or at least reduced) control is debateable, though worth noting that the two things are not mutually exclusive. Wherever you land in that debate, its clear that the consortium leaders took the vehicle in a direction that the Church wouldn’t go naturally with direct assets, and thus you can see that the Church had lost control.



    * The church put its reputation in the hands of a partner / consortium, and lost control of it. Lots of veterans living in PCV, and were treated badly (which carries a huge reputational penalty that goes beyond the usual rep risk of mistreating customers / residents / tenants). Though I’m sure you’ll find examples where people might say otherwise, generally speaking the Church tries to be a ‘compassionate landlord’ that ‘does the right thing’ when managing directly owned assets. Same cannot be said re: PCV.

		##  Summing up<span class="subtitle"><br></span>

		* Measurement challenges
			- “Raw” REIT returns do not measure pure asset return
			- Impact of financing, different investment strategies
			- Appraisal-based returns are not ideal either: too smooth
		* Representativeness questions affect all indices
			- Does it matter for market segments that are not available for investments? Probably not. But holdings of private investors, SWF, etc. are part of the investable universe.
		* Are REITs Real Estate?
			- In the long run, yes.
